### Business Case
  
Another initiative from Danny - Bank Data - some sort of intersection between Neo-Banks 
  (new aged digital only banks without physical branches), cryptocurrency and the data world.

The management team at Data Bank want to increase their total customer base - but also need some help tracking just how much data storage their customers will need.
  **Calculating metrics, growth and analyse data to better forecast and plan for their future developments!**

## ðŸ›’ Case Study #5 - Data Mart

### Business Case
  
Data Mart is Dannyâ€™s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart.
  All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

Danny needs help to quantify the impact of this change on the sales performance for Data Mart and itâ€™s separate business areas.

The key business question to answer are the following:
- **What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?**
- **Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?**
- **What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?**
